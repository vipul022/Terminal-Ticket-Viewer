## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to complete a coding challenge. The complete description of the app is given below:

Zendesk is a customer service tool that allows the creation and management of support tickets.
Your company needs you to build a Ticket Viewer that will:

- Connect to the Zendesk API

- Request all the tickets for your account

- Display them in a list

- Display individual ticket details

- Page through tickets when more than 25 are returned

###### Non-functional requirements:

- Include a README with installation and usage instructions

- The UI can be browser-based or CLI (see example output below)

- The amount of data you display in the ticket list view and the single ticket view is up to
  you

- How you format and display the ticket data is up to you, just ensure it is easy to read

- The Ticket Viewer should handle the API being unavailable

- We need to see you write at least a few happy path tests

```
